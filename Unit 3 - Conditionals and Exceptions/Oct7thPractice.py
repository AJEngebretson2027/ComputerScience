# Boolean Expresion
# king like a mathmatical formula
# can only evaluate to true or false
# Are my shoes tied? > true
# is 5 > 7? false
print(5 > 7)

# comparison oprtators == > < >= <=
# kinda like arithmetic operators + - / * ** % //
x = 5               #set x equal to 5, tell it what to be
print(x == 5)       # get x equals to 5, ask a question
#the difference is that we are using one or two equal signs
#this is a perfect test question

print(4 >= 2)           # true
print(1993 == 1993)     # true
print(-90 < -99)        # false
print(10 != 10)         # false "bash" "not"



#Boolean Expressions quiz
ans_one = input("give me an integer that is negative")
ans_one = int(ans_one)
print(ans_one < 0)
ans_two = input("write the number 5\n>")
# ans_two = int(ans_two) this is unnecessary
print(ans_two == "5")

print("walrus" == "walrus")     # == is totally valid for 2 strings
